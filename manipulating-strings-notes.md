# Manipulating Python Strings / Notes

- By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
    - use the `len()` function to count the number of characters in a string
    - use **square bracket notation** to extract (get or grab) a single character from a string
    - use **square bracket notation** and **index numbers** to slice several characters out of string
    - convert a string to uppercase characters
    - convert a string to lowercase characters
    - use single and double quotes correctly with a string
 
## Things To Remember About Working with Strings

- You can manipulate or work with strings in several different ways to produce useful information
- A **string** is an example of a **data type** you can work with in Python
- Other Python data types include:
    -  numeric (numbers)
    -  lists (known as *arrays** in other programming languages)
    -  dictionaries
    -  Boolean data type (Booleans represent one of two values: `True` or `False`)
- **String data** is always treated as text in your Python script, even if it contains numeric characters
    -  `first_name = 'Alyssa'` (where **Alyssa** is a string)
    -  `street_address = '457 Oak Street'` (where **457 Oak Street** is also a string, even though it contains the number 457)
